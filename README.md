# Detection of Copy-Rotate-Move Forgery Using Zernike Moments - DIP Project
As forgeries have become popular, the importance of forgery detection is much increased. Copy-move forgery, one of the most com- monly used methods, copies a part of the image and pastes it into an- other part of the the image. In this paper, we propose a detection method of copy-move forgery that localizes duplicated regions using Zernike mo- ments. Since the magnitude of Zernike moments is algebraically invariant against rotation, the proposed method can detect a forged region even though it is rotated. Our scheme is also resilient to the intentional dis- tortions such as additive white Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, and blurring. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is appropriate to identify the forged region by copy-rotate-move forgery.
